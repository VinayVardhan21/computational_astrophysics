  maybe create fake RV data from a system with 4 planets (with some inclination)
  and try to recover their orbital periods?

* FFT

  for C++, consider using pocketFFT -- this is C++ header, and is used by NumPy
  https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/mtr/pocketfft/tree/cpp

  we can pass in the `.data()` of the underlying vector.
