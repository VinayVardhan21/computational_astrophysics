* ODEs:

  * Trojan asteroids (from Hellings book): switch into the rotating
    frame for S-J system and trojan initial conditions from Rabe
    (1961)

    Table I gives initial conditions

  * Star formation in the Galaxy (also from Hellings book)

    This is essentially Eq. 4 from Bodifee (1986)

  * Lots of ODE examples in "Astrophysics through Computation"

* Root finding:

  Do Fermi integral and find mu given a number density

* Interpolation:

  EOS interpolation?
