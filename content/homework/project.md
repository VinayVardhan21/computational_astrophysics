# Course Project

```{note}
This is a work in progress and will be finalized after Spring Break
```



You will turn in:

* You code (it can be as a Jupyter notebook) if your wrote your own
  implementation of a method.

* Detailed instructions on how to obtain, modify, and reproduce your
  results using an external code if you chose to use that.

* A PDF write-up (abstract, introduction, description of what you did
  / results, figures, references).  This is something that you can use
  for the upper-level writing requirement, if desired.




Some inspiration for projects:

* Integrate the pressure and energy for an electron gas (building on
  the example we did for the degeneracy parameter).

* Implement the Barnes-Hut tree algorithm for approximating N-body gravity.

* Any of the ODE example applications listed here:
  https://zingale.github.io/computational_astrophysics/ODEs/more-applications.html

* Extending our linear advection solver to two-dimensions.

* Reproduce the analysis of any astro paper that has publicly available data.


Things to discuss in your write-up:

* Explain how the algorithm works, referring to the topics we learned
  in class.

* Show that things converge (if applicable)

* Show some example tests where we know the right behavior (if applicable)
