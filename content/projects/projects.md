# Final Project

```{note}
This list provides some ideas for the final course project.
You may choose your own topic as well.  Regardless of the topic, you
should explain what you are doing, provide code to demonstrate the
method, and show results and tests indicating that what you have
written behaves correctly.

1. Resonances in the asteroid belt.

   The asteroid belt in our solar system shows gaps in the
   distribution of semi-major axes of the asteroids corresponding to
   orbit resonances with Jupiter.  These are called the [Kirkwood
   gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_gap).

   Let's consider the case where the mass of the asteroids is so
   insignificant that we can ignore their gravity, and we only need to
   worry about the gravity of Jupiter and the Sun.  Create a
   simulation with 100-1000 asteroids spanning the region where they
   exist in our solar system today.  You can start them off with
   circular orbits.  Evolve the system, with the asteroids
   experiencing the gravity of Jupiter and the Sun and look at the
   distribution of semimajor axes after many orbital periods&mdash;do
   you see evolution? hints of resonances?


2. SPH for advection


3. Poisson problem with FFTs
