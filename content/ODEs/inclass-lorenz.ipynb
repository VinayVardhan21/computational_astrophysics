    "We'll consider the [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system).  This is a toy-model of atmospheric convection.  In a seminal paper, [Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/20/2/1520-0469_1963_020_0130_dnf_2_0_co_2.xml), Lorenz explored this system and showed that it exhibited [chaotic behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "The system can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\frac{dx}{dt} &= \\sigma (y - x) \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dy}{dt} &= x (r - z) - y \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dz}{dt} &= xy - b z \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is related to the intensity of the convective motion, $y$ is related to the temperature difference between up and down currents, and $z$ is related to the departure of the temperature profile from linear (with height).  The constants have the following meanings: $\\sigma$ is the [Prandtl number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prandtl_number), $r$ is the [Rayleigh number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_number) (scaled to the critical value), and $b$ is needed to define the critical Rayleigh number.\n",

    "Lorenz chose $\\sigma = 10$, $b = 8/3$, and $r = 28$"
