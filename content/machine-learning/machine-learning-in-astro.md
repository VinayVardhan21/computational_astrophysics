# Machine Learning in Astronomy

Machine learning techniques are used for both observational and theoretical applications.

## Example notebooks:

* [Hello Universe](https://archive.stsci.edu/hello-universe): A framework for
  testing and benchmarking machine learning methods on astronomical data.

* [astroML](https://www.astroml.org/) has a set of examples that work with
  scikit-learn.
