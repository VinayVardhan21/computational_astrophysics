# Machine Learning Libraries

There are a number of popular libraries that implement machine learning algorithms.
Their features and performance vary quite a bit.  An comparison of their
features is provided by Wikipedia: [Comparison of deep learning software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_deep_learning_software).

Some additional comparisons are provided here: https://ritza.co/articles/scikit-learn-vs-tensorflow-vs-pytorch-vs-keras/

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

  This is an open source machine learning library released by Google.  It has support
  for CPUs, GPUs, and [TPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit),
  and provides all the features you need to build deep learning workflows:
  [TensorFlow feactures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow#Features).
  
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

  This is a machine learning library build off of the Torch library, originally
  developed by Facebook.
  
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

  This is a python library developed for machine learning.  It has a lot of
  sample datasets that provide a nice means to learn how different methods work.
  It is designed to work with NumPy and SciPy.
  
  General recommendations on the web seem to be to use Scikit-learn to get
  started with machine learning and to explore ideas, but to switch to
  one of the other packages for computationally-intensive work.
  
There are also tools that provide higher-level interfaces to these

* [Keras](https://keras.io/)

  Keras is built on top of TensorFlow and provides a nice python interface that
  hides a lot of the implementation details in TensorFlow.
