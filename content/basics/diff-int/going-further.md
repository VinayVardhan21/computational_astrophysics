=============

There are many other types of integration methods that are useful.

A very powerful technique is [Gaussian
quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature) of
which Gauss-Legendre quadrature is one of the most popular techniques.
By using $N$ points, Gauss-Legendre can exactly integrate a polynomial
of order $2N - 1$!
