AST 390: Computational Astrophysics
===================================

Spring 2023

This is a collection of notebooks on computational (astro)physics.
Starting at the beginning, these notebooks introduce numerical methods
for derivatives, integration, rooting finding, ODEs, and linear algebra
and then move onto applications in astrophysics.
