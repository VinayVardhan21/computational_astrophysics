AST 390: Computational Astrophysics
===================================

Michael Zingale

Spring 2023

This is a collection of notebooks on computational (astro)physics.
Starting at the beginning, these notebooks introduce numerical methods
for derivatives, integration, rooting finding, ODEs, and linear algebra
and then move onto applications in astrophysics.

By clicking on the "rocket ship" icon, you can launch the notebook
in google colab or binder to run it in the cloud.
