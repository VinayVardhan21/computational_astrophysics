Course Overview
===============

This is a special topics class on computational astrophysics.  The
main prerequisite is that you have taken PHY 277: *Computation for
Physics and Astronomy*.  Usually, PHY 277 teaches Fortran and C++.

In this course, I will also use python, since it makes interactive
coding during the lectures a lot easier.

```{note}
You are free to use whichever programming language you are
most comfortable with for assignments.  I will do interactive
demonstrations primarily in python and I will provide C++
implementations of all of the main algorithms we discuss in class.
```

One of the goals of this class is to get everyone more comfortable
with programming, so you should ask questions about programming as
they arise during the semester.

Some resources:

* My python class notes are available at: https://sbu-python-class.github.io/python-science/Introduction.html

* My C++ class notes are available at: https://zingale.github.io/phy504/

```{note}
You are welcomed to sit in on my python class this semester,
PHY 546: *Python for Scientific Computing* which meets on Monday's at 4:25 pm
