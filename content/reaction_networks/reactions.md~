Reaction Rates
--------------

Nuclear experiments provide us with reaction rates of the form (for a 2-body reaction):

$$r = \frac{n_A n_B}{1 + \delta_{AB}} \langle \sigma v \rangle$$

where $n_A$ is the number density of species A and $n_B$ is the number
density of species B.  The denominator ensures that we don't double
count for a species reacting with itself.  The term $\langle \sigma v
\rangle$ is the average of the cross section and velocity over the
distribution of velocities in the frame of the reaction.  This is what is
measured by experiements.

Here the rate, $r$, has units of reactions / time / volume.


Reaction databases (like ReacLib) often provide $N_A \langle \sigma v
\rangle$, where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number.
